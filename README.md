# Review Button

This simple Anki addon inserts a Review button that's adjacent to the 'Study Now' button in each deck's overview page to quickly schedule a custom study session with decks marked as 'Learning' and 'To review'." It can be triggered with the <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> shortcut. This makes it much more seamless than the traditional method of launching a Custom Study, choosing the `Study by card state or tag`, selecting `Due cards only` and then clicking on `Choose Tags`.
